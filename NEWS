The former Procedural Creation Project is promoted to Distributed Procedural
Creation Project! A distributed PC module is implemented as a secondary
region module. PCVM works as an Erlang node to participate in a distributed
application.


Welcome to Procedural Creation Project

Procedural Creation Project offers another way to create virtual-world
contents, scripting all creation processes. The goal of the project, however,
is not necessarily to replace interactive creation you have been already doing
in today's virtual-world client software, such as SL viewer and its variants.
Instead, the project will propose an entirely different approach for artists
and designers to explore 3D drawings in procedural fashion.
